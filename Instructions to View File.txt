Instructions to View File
 
Select the zipped file. Click “Download” or “View raw.” Once downloaded, click on the file name or folder. Because the file is in JSON format, options to open may vary based on your device. Common options include selecting “Open” to a default program, or selecting “Open With” then choosing Word, Notepad, or Wordpad. Free JSON viewers may also be available through your browser and the Internet.
